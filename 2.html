                    <p>A Sword swallower, escapologist and entertainer, this Irish man is going to catch ur breath this Ragam. Murray Molloy takes the ancient art of sword swallowing and truly makes it his own. His unique blend of subtle comedy, death-defying stunts and Irish charm culminates in a show that one will never forget. His interest in the world of shows spawned from childhood trips to the circus, and an eccentric neighbour who thought him magic tricks. After insufficient research and at the tender age of eighteen, he took his first steps along the perilous path of self-taught fire eating. Shortly afterwards, while his blistered tongue was still healing, he constructed his first bed of nails and started performing on the streets of Dublin. After many years of continuous travelling, training and touring he has expanded his repertoire to include escaping from straitjackets, contortionism, balloon modelling and swallowing swords.</p><p> He is one of only fifty artists sufficiently trained enough to swallow swords currently performing in the world. He has studied artistic administration, clown, improvisation and theatre and has performed everywhere from Australia to Laos, Portugal to Fiji, on the streets, in bars, nightclubs, festivals, in front of Tribal Chiefs and government dignitaries. This man never forgets to leave the audience spellbound. This Ragam catch him live at NITC !!!</p>
